    <p class="card-text">Have you ever lost your pet and started freaking out thinking of how to find your pal? Well
      that is the exact problem we are solving with this site! Pet finder allows you to create an account so that you
      can create a report about your lost buddy, submit a picture of them and some details about where they got lost so
      that we can bring the massive community of the internet to help find your pet! Create an account to file a report,
      but anyone can look at the map which will display where pets where last seen. We are hopefull we can help you get
      reunited with your friend so you can go back to enjoying each others company.</p>

        opportunity to take some classes. Once here, I registered for computer Science (Java) at Bellevue College.
        Today, I have a chance to take a certificate class in software engineer developer front-End and Back-End at
        the University of Washington. After the first project, this second project was very helpful. With my crew, we
        have successfully
        built something from scratch, and step by step the project took form. It was amazing to work with all of my team
        mates
        to build this magnific Lost pet application.</p>
